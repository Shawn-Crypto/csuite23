# Webhook System - Simplified

## 🎯 **What It Does**

The webhook system is **SIMPLE** and does exactly what's needed:

1. **Receives payment confirmation** from Razorpay
2. **Verifies signature** for security  
3. **Responds immediately** (<200ms) to keep Razorpay happy
4. **Logs the payment** for our records
5. **That's it!** 

## 🔄 **Payment Flow**

```
Customer pays → Razorpay → Our Webhook → Done ✅
                     ↓
              Razorpay → Zapier → Kajabi (course delivery)
```

- ✅ Signature verification working  
- ✅ Payment amounts logged correctly
- ✅ Performance optimized (<200ms response)
- ✅ Error handling in place
- ❌ **No Zapier complexity on our end**

## 🚀 **Course Delivery**

**We don't handle course delivery** - that's Razorpay → Zapier → Kajabi's job.

Our webhook just:
- Confirms "Yes, payment received"  
- Logs it for our records
- Lets Razorpay do the rest

**Simple. Clean. Works.**
