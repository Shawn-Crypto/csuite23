Section Title:
Frequently Asked Questions

Section Subtitle:
Get answers to common questions about our course, learning approach, and what you can expect from your investment education journey.

FAQ Questions and Answers:

Q: Is this course suitable for complete beginners?
A: Absolutely. This course is designed to take you from zero knowledge to confident analysis. We start with the fundamental concepts that every investor needs to understand, then gradually build your expertise using the same progression used to train institutional analysts.

No prior finance background is required-just a commitment to learning and the patience to work through the material systematically.

Q: How is this different from free YouTube content?
A: Structure and depth. While YouTube offers scattered tips and opinions, this course provides a comprehensive, sequential curriculum based on institutional methodologies.

- The exact frameworks used at top investment firms
- How concepts connect and build upon each other
- Practical application through real case studies
- Professional-grade analysis techniques simplified for individual learners

Think of it as the difference between reading random articles about medicine versus taking a structured medical course.

A: 17+ years of institutional experience. Rohit has held senior research positions at ICRA (Moody's company) and Bank of Baroda Capital Markets, where he advised on over ‚Çπ10 trillion in institutional assets.
