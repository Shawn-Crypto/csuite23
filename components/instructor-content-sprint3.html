<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 24px; color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95);">
    <strong>The Academic Foundation:</strong> Armed with an MBA in Finance and B.Sc. in Mathematics from Mumbai University, Rohit approaches market analysis with both quantitative rigor and qualitative insight.

    <h4 style="color: #F4A261; font-size: 20px; margin-bottom: 16px; font-weight: 700;">Why Institutional Experience Matters for Individual Investors</h4>
    <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 16px;">
        "Most online educators teach theory or share opinions. I teach the actual methodologies used by professionals managing billions of rupees. These aren't just academic concepts—they're battle-tested frameworks that have created real wealth across market cycles."
    </p>
    <p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9); line-height: 1.7; font-style: italic;">
        "My goal isn't to make you dependent on tips or market timing. It's to give you the analytical independence that institutional investors possess—the ability to make informed decisions based on fundamental analysis, risk assessment, and systematic thinking."
    </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 24px; color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95);">
    <strong>The Teaching Philosophy:</strong> Unlike content creators who focus on entertainment or quick wins, Rohit's approach mirrors institutional training programs—systematic, comprehensive, and designed to build lasting analytical skills. Every concept taught in this course has been used in real institutional settings to evaluate actual investment opportunities.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 32px; color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95);">
    <strong>From Institutional Boardrooms to Individual Empowerment:</strong> After years of advising institutional clients, Rohit recognized a critical gap—while institutional investors had access to sophisticated analytical frameworks, individual investors were left with tips, opinions, and simplified advice. This course bridges that gap, democratizing institutional-grade investment education for serious individual learners.
