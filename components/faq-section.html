                            <p><strong>Absolutely.</strong> This course is designed to take you from zero knowledge to confident analysis. We start with the fundamental concepts that every investor needs to understand, then gradually build your expertise using the same progression used to train institutional analysts.</p>
                            <p>No prior finance background is required—just a commitment to learning and the patience to work through the material systematically.</p>

                            <p><strong>Flexible, but consistent.</strong> The total content is approximately 17-20 hours, but you can learn at your own pace.</p>
                            <p>Recommended approach:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Intensive:</strong> 1-2 hours daily for 2-3 weeks</li>
                                <li><strong>Steady:</strong> 3-4 hours weekly for 6-8 weeks</li>
                                <li><strong>Casual:</strong> 1-2 hours weekly for 3-4 months</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The key is consistency rather than speed. You have lifetime access, so you can revisit concepts as needed.</p>
