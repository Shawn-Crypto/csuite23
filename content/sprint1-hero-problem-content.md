### Problem Cards (4 Educational Challenges):

#### Card 1: Information Without Structure
**Icon:** üìä
**Headline:** "Drowning in Unstructured Information"
**Content:** "The internet is flooded with stock tips, contradictory advice, and fragmented information. Without a systematic framework to process this data, you're left more confused than confident. Professional investors don't consume random tips ‚Äì they follow structured analytical processes."

#### Card 2: The Jargon Barrier
**Icon:** üìö
**Headline:** "Financial Language Feels Foreign"
**Content:** "PE ratios, ROCE, FCF, EBITDA ‚Äì the financial world speaks its own language. This terminology barrier prevents many from truly understanding company fundamentals. Our course translates complex concepts into clear, understandable frameworks you can actually apply."

#### Card 3: Analysis Paralysis
**Icon:** üß©
**Headline:** "No Clear Framework for Decision-Making"
**Content:** "You've read the news, checked the charts, but still feel uncertain. That's because consuming information isn't the same as having an analytical framework. Learn the step-by-step processes that professionals use to evaluate opportunities systematically."

#### Card 4: The Knowledge-Action Gap
**Icon:** üéØ
**Headline:** "Theory Without Practical Application"
**Content:** "Most financial education stays theoretical. You need frameworks that bridge the gap between understanding concepts and applying them. Our course focuses on practical, actionable methodologies used in real institutional settings."

### Alternative Problem Set (More Beginner-Friendly):

#### Card 1: Starting Point Confusion
**Icon:** üó∫Ô∏è
**Headline:** "Don't Know Where to Begin"
**Content:** "The investment world seems vast and complex. Without a clear learning path, it's easy to feel lost. This course provides a structured journey from foundational concepts to advanced analysis techniques."

#### Card 2: Trust & Credibility Issues
**Icon:** ü§ù
**Headline:** "Too Many 'Experts,' Too Little Substance"
**Content:** "Social media is full of self-proclaimed gurus with questionable credentials. Learn from someone with verifiable institutional experience who's analyzed companies for the world's largest investors."

#### Card 3: Time Constraints
**Icon:** ‚è∞
**Headline:** "Busy Professional, Limited Time"
**Content:** "You want to learn but have a demanding career. Our course is designed for efficiency ‚Äì learn the 20% of concepts that drive 80% of analytical value. No fluff, just actionable frameworks."

#### Card 4: Confidence Gap
**Icon:** üí°
**Headline:** "Lack Confidence in Your Analysis"
**Content:** "Second-guessing every decision? That's what happens without proper education. Build genuine confidence through understanding, not blind faith in tips or trends."
