**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** August 7, 2025  
**Product:** Lotuslion Course Website Payment System Migration

## Product overview

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the Lotuslion course website (lotuslion.in) from external Cashfree payment form links to an embedded Razorpay API integration. The project aims to create a seamless, on-page checkout experience while implementing proper backend infrastructure for transaction management, verification, and analytics.

### Document title/version

## Narrative

As a working professional interested in learning investment analysis, I discover the Lotuslion course through online research or social media. After reading through the comprehensive course content and instructor credentials, I'm convinced this is the right educational investment for my career growth.

When I click "ENROLL NOW," instead of being redirected to an unfamiliar external website, a professional checkout modal appears right on the same page. I can see the course details clearly laid out alongside the payment options. The form asks for my basic information - name, email, and phone number - which feels reasonable for a course purchase.

The payment section shows all my preferred options: UPI for quick mobile payments, my saved cards, and net banking. The total amount is clearly displayed as ₹1,999 with no hidden fees. When I select UPI and complete the payment on my phone, the confirmation appears instantly with my order details and next steps.

Within minutes, I receive a professional email with my payment receipt and course access instructions. I feel confident about my purchase and excited to begin learning from institutional-grade content. The entire experience felt trustworthy and professional, reinforcing my decision to invest in this educational opportunity.

## Technical considerations

### Integration points

**Razorpay API Integration**
The system will integrate with Razorpay's REST API for order creation, payment processing, and transaction verification. This includes implementing proper API authentication, request signing, and response validation to ensure secure communication.

**Vercel Serverless Functions**  
All backend functionality will be implemented as Vercel serverless functions to maintain the current hosting architecture. Functions will handle order creation, payment verification, webhook processing, and customer management operations.

**Supabase Database Integration**
Supabase will serve as the primary database for storing orders, customers, payments, and system logs. The integration will utilize Supabase's REST API and real-time capabilities for efficient data management.

**Email Service Integration**
Integration with an email service provider (likely SendGrid or similar) for transactional emails including order confirmations, payment receipts, and course access instructions.

### Data storage/privacy

**Customer Data Protection**
All customer information will be encrypted at rest and in transit. Personal information including names, email addresses, and phone numbers will be stored in Supabase with appropriate access controls and encryption. Payment card details will never be stored locally, maintaining PCI compliance through Razorpay's secure processing.

**GDPR Compliance**
The system will implement data minimization principles, collecting only necessary customer information. Clear privacy policies will be presented during checkout, and customers will have rights to data access, modification, and deletion upon request.

**Payment Data Security**
Sensitive payment information will be handled exclusively by Razorpay's PCI-compliant infrastructure. Only transaction references and status information will be stored in the project's database, ensuring compliance with payment security standards.

### Scalability/performance

**Serverless Architecture Benefits**
Vercel's serverless functions automatically scale based on demand, eliminating concerns about traffic spikes during promotional periods or viral marketing campaigns. Each function operates independently, preventing system-wide failures.

**Database Performance Optimization**
Supabase queries will be optimized with appropriate indexing on frequently accessed fields like customer email, order ID, and transaction status. Connection pooling will be implemented to handle concurrent requests efficiently.

**Caching Strategy**
Static assets and frequently accessed data will be cached at the CDN level through Vercel's edge network. API responses for order lookups and customer data will implement appropriate caching headers to reduce database load.

### Potential challenges

**Payment Gateway Reliability**
Dependency on Razorpay's uptime and performance could impact sales during outages. Mitigation includes comprehensive error handling, graceful fallbacks, and clear communication to users during service issues.

**Webhook Processing Complexity**
Asynchronous webhook processing requires careful handling of race conditions, duplicate notifications, and retry logic. The implementation must ensure order status consistency even under high load or intermittent failures.

**Cross-Browser Compatibility**
The Razorpay checkout widget must function consistently across all supported browsers and devices. Extensive testing will be required across different platforms, with fallback experiences for unsupported scenarios.

**Transaction Verification Security**
Proper signature verification is critical for preventing fraudulent transactions. The implementation must correctly validate all webhook signatures and payment confirmations to maintain transaction integrity.
