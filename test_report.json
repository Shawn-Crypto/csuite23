    "key_findings": "The application shows a high-quality profile with a strong success rate in backend API testing. However, significant failures in critical API endpoints, particularly the Razorpay Webhook and payment verification, indicate severe risks. The frontend testing was limited and revealed major issues in responsive design and core functionalities like payment processing and user input validation.",
    "recommendations": "It is crucial to prioritize fixing the backend API failures, especially the webhook's inability to handle basic requests, which is business-critical. Frontend development should focus on implementing robust responsive design and ensuring all user-facing components, especially payment and lead capture forms, are fully functional and validated."
